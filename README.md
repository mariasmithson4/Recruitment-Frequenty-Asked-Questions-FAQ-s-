## Is there anything specific I should prepare for prior to the interview?

We recommend the following:

  

1.  Read through our [Glassdoor](https://www.glassdoor.com/Overview/Working-at-Faithlife-EI_IE888280.11,20.htm) reviews to get a sense of what it’s like to work at Faithlife.
    

  

2.  Look through our products listed on [Faithlife.com](https://equip.faithlife.com) — is there a specific product you’d like to work on? If so, tell the person/people you interview with!
    

  

3.  We recommend answering behavioral interview questions utilizing the STAR interview format. Here’s [an article](https://www.themuse.com/advice/star-interview-method) that describes how to use STAR.
    

  

4.  You’re interviewing us just as much as we’re interviewing you! Prior to your interview, we recommend that you write down the questions you’d like to ask us.
    

  

5.  Have fun! We’re excited to get to know you better and have designed our interview process to showcase you at your best. Part of the reason we let developers use their favorite IDE in the coding challenge is because we want you to feel comfortable, confident, and excited to code. Best of luck in your interview! We’re rooting for you.
    

## What language will I use for pair programming?

We have two separate pair programming sessions done at different stages in the interview process.

  

In the first pair programming, you’re able to choose the language that you’re most comfortable with. Prior to the interview, you’ll receive an email with information that outlines the coding problem you’ll be working on. While we'd like you to have your IDE ready, you shouldn't write code ahead of time. Also, you'll want to use Chrome (not Safari) for the video call.

  

In the second pair programming, we want to see you write code in an unfamiliar situation. Most of the time, we choose the IDE and language you’ll code in and don’t provide the coding question ahead of time. As in the first pair programming, you’ll want to use Chrome (not Safari) when linking to the video call.

  

Faithlife’s Software Development interview process is designed to gradually increase in difficulty. Our goal is not to trip you up but to see a holistic view of your soft skills and technical abilities.
